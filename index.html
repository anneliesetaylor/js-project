            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee#cite_ref-mnn_4-0" target="_blank">Coffee</a> is a refreshment made from brewing roasted coffee beans. Served either hot or iced, the dark colored drink is slightly bitter in taste due to its acidic nature. It is one of <a href="https://www.treehugger.com/how-coffee-changed-the-world-4863683" target="_blank">the most popular drinks in the world</a> as a result of the stimulating effects it can produce from its caffeine content. The bitterness of the beverage is often counteracted by the addition of cream, milk, or other dairy substitutes in addition to sugar or alternative sweeteners.</p>

        <h2>How is Coffee Made?</h2>
        <div id="coffee_beans">
          <p>Coffee beans are derived from the seeds of berries from the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea" target="_blank">Coffea</a></i> plant species. The berries from the <i>Coffea</i> plant change in color from green to bright red to indicate they are ripe, allowing for them to be picked and processed in order to be dried. Once the beans have been roasted, these dried coffee seeds are what we know as coffee beans. The duration and temperature of the roasting process is determined by the desired flavor of the coffee, with varying degrees and timeframes impacting the flavor profile of the coffee beans when brewed.</p>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espresso" target="_blank">Espresso</a>, one of the most popular ways of brewing coffee beans, is a method of brewing that originated from Italy and uses a minimal amount of boiling water forced through finely-ground coffee beans using pressure. The process results in a small amount of thicker, more concentrated coffee.</p>
